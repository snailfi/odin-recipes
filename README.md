# odin-recipes
This is a small project to build a HTML page with links to 3 recipes. The recipes
have an image, description, ingredients, and steps required in order to prepare them.

The goal of this project is to summarize the elements that have been learned thus far. Three relative 
links were created that each link to a webpage where we have added headings, an image, paragraphs, 
an unordered list, and an ordered list.
