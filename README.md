# odin-recipes
This is a small project to build a relatively simple website with links to 3 recipes. The recipes
have an image, description, ingredients, and steps required in order to prepare them. The project
also had the aim of getting comfortable adding and commiting to Git with meaningful commit messages.

The goal of this project is to summarize the elements that have been learned thus far. Three relative 
links were created that each link to a webpage where we have added headings, an image, paragraphs, 
an unordered list, and an ordered list.

Asides from the html portion of the project, we were told to add and commit changes to Git as the project
progressed. This had the goal of encouraging us to get in the flow of writing commit messages that are 
properly structured, such as the use of imperative in the subject line.
