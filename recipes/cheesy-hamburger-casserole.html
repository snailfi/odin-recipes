            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a hamburger rice casserole that is topped with cheese.</p>
            <p>The simplicity in preparation makes it well worth making!</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
                <li>½ cup long grain white rice</li>
                <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned.</li>
                <li>Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup, tomatoes, and uncooked rice.</li>
                <li>Cover, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the contents of the skillet to a casserole dish. Cover with a layer of cheese.</li>
                <li>Broil until the cheese is melted and toasty. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy!</li>
